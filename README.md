📝 Next Word Prediction with LSTM

An end-to-end Next Word Prediction System using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model leverages an LSTM-based architecture trained on text sequences with early stopping, and is deployed via Streamlit for real-time predictions.

✨ Features

Predicts the next word in a given text sequence.

Built with LSTM neural networks for sequence modeling.

Uses tokenization, sequence padding, and embeddings.

Deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app.
